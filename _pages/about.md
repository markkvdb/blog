Hello! My name is Mark van der Broek and I'm passionate about combining *operations research*, *data science* and *computer science*.

### History

At the age of 12 I discovered the power of fun in programming by making small hobby websites (offline nowadays) using technologies like *HTML*, *CSS* and *PHP*. During my undergraduate degree in Econometrics and Operations Research I found my love for modeling problems using mathematical models in applications like finance, actuarial sciences, logistics and data analytics. I quickly realised that becoming fluent in the main programming languages like *Python*, *R* and *C++* was fundemental for applying these mathematical models in real-life. This is why I followed an extra-curricular C++ programming course by [Frank Brokken and Jurjen Bokma](http://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/). More recently with the increasing popularity of *machine learning* and *deep learning* I started following the hands-on [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course.
